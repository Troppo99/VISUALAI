  <h1>This is Seiso Streaming</h1>
  <h2>In the context of an AI computer vision project, Seiso refers to the detection of cleaning activities focused on
  specific objects within a factory setting. The AI system uses computer vision techniques to monitor and identify the
  cleaning of designated areas or objects, ensuring that these tasks are performed effectively and consistently. By
  analyzing video footage, the AI can track whether cleaning actions are being carried out as required, detecting any gaps
  or inefficiencies in the cleaning process. This not only helps maintain a cleaner and safer factory environment but also
  contributes to operational efficiency by providing real-time feedback and ensuring compliance with cleanliness
  standards.</h2>
