          for 5S Implementation at PT Gistex Garmen Indonesia
        </h2>
        <p class="text-center">
          In the dynamic environment of PT Gistex Garmen Indonesia,
          maintaining an organized and efficient workspace is paramount.
          To uphold the principles of 5S—Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain—
          the company has integrated an advanced AI-powered CCTV system tailored
          specifically for their manufacturing areas.

        <h2>Customized AI Models for Precision Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Our AI CCTV system operates on a dedicated server, ensuring data security
          and real-time processing capabilities. By leveraging custom-trained machine
          learning models, the system is finely tuned to recognize and evaluate specific
          5S criteria within the factory premises. This customization allows for accurate
          detection of compliance levels, identifying areas that require attention
          and improvement.</p>

        <h2>Comprehensive Training Process</h2>
        <p>The development of our AI models involves extensive training using data
          collected directly from the factory environment. This hands-on approach
          ensures that the system understands the unique layout, workflows, and
          operational nuances of PT Gistex Garmen Indonesia. Through continuous learning,
          the AI adapts to changes in the workspace, maintaining high accuracy in monitoring 5S standards.</p>

        <h2>Empowering 5S Supervisors</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of this project is to support 5S Supervisors
          in maintaining orderliness and adherence to established guidelines.
          The AI CCTV system provides supervisors with actionable insights
          and detailed reports, enabling them to swiftly address any deviations
          from the 5S protocols. By automating the monitoring process,
          supervisors can focus on strategic improvements rather than manual inspections.</p>
