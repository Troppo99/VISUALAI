Currently:
This Five S app has some project with:

1. Core and play codes are in their folder projects
2. Library Scheduler and Data handler are in folder libs
3. Data handler is imported in core code
4. Core code is imported in Scheduler module
5. Play code just make a run code and play all of them in multiprocess directly

Improvement:

1. Make a spesific scheduling for each camera that configured in play code {start:2025-01-21T11:01:34}
2. just share play code to the others computer for running
3. Save core, data handler, scheduler into libs folder in one computer server
